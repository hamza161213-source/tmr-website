        <h2>What Is Reformer Pilates — and Why Is Everyone Obsessed?</h2>
        <p>Reformer Pilates has taken the fitness world by storm, and for good reason. Unlike traditional mat Pilates, reformer training uses a machine with springs, pulleys, and a sliding carriage to provide resistance and support throughout each movement.</p>
        <h3>The Power of Controlled Resistance</h3>
        <p>What makes reformer Pilates unique is the level of control and precision it demands. Every movement is intentional, guided by breath and alignment. The reformer allows you to adjust resistance by changing the spring tension, making it accessible for beginners while offering serious challenge for advanced practitioners.</p>
        <h3>Why the Obsession?</h3>
        <p>People are drawn to reformer Pilates because it delivers real results. You build long, lean muscles through controlled resistance training. You strengthen your core, improve posture, and develop functional strength that translates into everyday life. But beyond the physical benefits, reformer Pilates cultivates mindfulness—you can't rush through a class. Every rep counts, and that presence creates a sense of calm and purpose that leaves you feeling stronger and more grounded.</p>
        <p>Whether you're recovering from injury, looking to tone up, or seeking a mindful workout, reformer Pilates offers something for everyone.</p>

        <h2>How Often Should You Do Reformer Pilates for Results?</h2>
        <p>One of the most common questions we hear at The Method Room is: "How often do I need to do reformer Pilates to see results?" The answer depends on your goals, fitness level, and lifestyle—but we've got some guidance to help you create the perfect routine.</p>
        <h3>Consistency Over Intensity</h3>
        <p>With reformer Pilates, consistency is key. Unlike high-intensity workouts that require longer recovery periods, reformer training is lower impact and can be done more frequently. Most fitness experts recommend at least 2–3 classes per week to see noticeable results within 4–6 weeks.</p>
        <h3>The Ideal Schedule</h3>
        <p><strong>Beginners (0–3 months):</strong> 2–3 classes per week to build foundational strength and learn proper form.</p>
        <p><strong>Intermediate:</strong> 3–4 classes per week to progress and see muscle toning and strength gains.</p>
        <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> 4–5 classes per week, mixing class types (Foundations, Flow, Strength) for well-rounded progress.</p>
        <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
        <p>What matters most is showing up with intention. One focused, mindful class per week beats three rushed, distracted sessions. Our small-group classes ensure you get the attention and guidance you need to make every session count.</p>

        <h2>Why We Believe in Small Classes</h2>
        <p>At The Method Room, we cap every class at 8 reformers. This isn't arbitrary—it's central to our philosophy. Small groups create better results, safer practices, and a more meaningful experience for every participant.</p>
        <h3>Personal Attention Matters</h3>
        <p>In a small class, your instructor can watch your form, offer real-time adjustments, and tailor guidance to your body's needs. This level of attention prevents injury and ensures you're working at the right intensity for your fitness level. Whether you're recovering from a back issue or pushing for advanced progression, our instructors adapt to you.</p>
        <h3>Community, Not Crowding</h3>
        <p>Large group fitness classes can feel impersonal and overwhelming, especially if you're new to reformer Pilates. In our small-group setting, you build relationships with fellow practitioners and instructors. You become part of a community, not just another face in a crowded studio. This sense of belonging keeps people coming back and makes fitness feel like self-care, not a chore.</p>
        <h3>Safety First</h3>
        <p>The reformer is a powerful tool, and when used correctly, it's incredibly safe and effective. But improper form can lead to compensation patterns and injury. With 8 people max, our instructors ensure every movement is executed with precision. We prioritize injury prevention and sustainable, long-term strength building.</p>
        <h3>Better Results</h3>
        <p>Studies show that small-group training creates better adherence rates and faster progress than large classes. When you feel seen, supported, and challenged appropriately, you stay committed. Our clients report faster strength gains, better body awareness, and a deeper sense of accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Quality over quantity. That's The Method Room way.</p>
